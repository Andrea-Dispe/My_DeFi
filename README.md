# My DeFi PLatform

All the contracts I used in this project is taken from (Alpaca Finance GitHub contract repo)[https://github.com/alpaca-finance/bsc-alpaca-contract].

The app emulates the (Alpaca Fince DeFi Protocol)[https://www.alpacafinance.org/] in lending, staking and yield farming.

It connects to the lending, staking and farming pool in currently available in pancake swap and It connects the Metamask wallet to the Bsc (Binance Smart Chain)
